# Introduction

hangupsbot-plugins is a collection of plugins designed to work with Hangupsbot (https://github.com/tdryer/hangups):
* **tableflip**:
  You can either use "/bot tableflip" or "/me flips a table" (uses regex matching, so some variation is allowed for),
  and the bot will pull a random image from the collection of photos for the tableflip meme on http://knowyourmeme.com/
